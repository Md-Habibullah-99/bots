ðŸ”’ Security & Configuration Notice for Developers
ATTENTION: This code is structured to prioritize security by keeping sensitive data out of the source file.

To run this Discord bot successfully, you must configure the following environment variables. DO NOT replace the Python variables with hardcoded ID or token values, as this exposes your secrets.

Required Setup:
1. Bot Token: Set the DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable with your bot's secret token.
2. User Tracking: Set the TARGET_USER_IDS environment variable as a comma-separated string of user IDs (e.g., 12345,67890,54321).
3. Notification Channel: Set the NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID environment variable with the ID of the channel where alerts should be posted.

Local Development: It is highly recommended to use a .env file and the python-dotenv library to manage these secrets locally. Ensure your .gitignore file contains the line .env to prevent accidental public commits.
